## Interactive Pooling Applicaion with Socket IO and React.js

Socket technology is a natural fit for presentation and chat applications. This course helps you use Socket IO in combination with powerful JavaScript libraries to develop an interactive polling application that processes data in real time, allowing presenters to interact with audience members and graph their responses. Alex Banks shows each step in the process, starting with setting up the node environment and express app for development. You'll then create and connect sockets for real-time data sharing and set up routing and interface elements with React.js, refactoring those components for ES6 integration. This setup will allow you to program functionality for running presentations, joining presentations, asking and answering questions, and graphing the results of the poll.
